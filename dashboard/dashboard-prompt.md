Create a visual dashboard that Peter Pan will use to track Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) relevant to his journey back to Neverland (assume Neverland is the star, Sirius A). 



This dashboard is composed of the following:

1. PDUs (Pixie Dust Usage) => gauge

2. TTN (Time-to-Neverland) => number

3. Distance to Neverland => number in light-years

4. Current Cost of Pixie Dust => number in dollars



Refer to the attached screenshots to ideas for displaying numbers, charts and graphs.
